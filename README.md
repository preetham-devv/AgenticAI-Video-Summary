# Video Summarizer with Agentic AI, Phidata, and Google Gemini  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered video summarizer** that extracts key insights from long videos using **Agentic AI**, **Phidata**, and **Google Gemini**. It automatically generates concise summaries, making it easier to grasp essential information without watching the entire video.  

## 🎯 Motivation  
I developed this project because I had to listen to long videos in my course for discussions. Manually going through hours of content was time-consuming, so I built this tool to generate quick and accurate summaries, helping me focus on important points efficiently.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **AI-driven Summarization**: Uses Google Gemini to analyze and summarize video content.  
- **Agentic AI Workflow**: Automates the summarization process efficiently.  
- **Phidata Integration**: Manages data processing and storage.  
- **User-Friendly**: Simply input a video, and the AI generates a structured summary.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Google Gemini** (for AI-powered text generation)  
- **Phidata** (for data handling and processing)  
- **Python** (core programming language)  
- **Agentic AI** (for task automation)
